# Reference  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/GitHub-create-personal-token-CLI.html for information on how to generate the access token
# Reference https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html for mechanisms for providing this value.

#   a) add -var="key=value" to the terraform command line
#   b) create an environment variable of the form TF_VAR_key (example: export TF_VAR_github_oauth_token=1111111111) prior to invoking terraform
